## Short description

### What's the problem?

A system capable of assisting in the management of the stocks of a hypermarket was envisaged, a tool that could assist in receiving orders from suppliers and the movement of products from the warehouse to the sections and their respective shelves.

### How can the project help?

Nowadays the best solution for an effective management of a company is given by the computer development of it, in this point our software can help immensely in all the requested points and go beyond to effectively be a fundamental piece of any company in the day- the day.

### Project Objective

The project seeks to resolve all requests in all areas intended by the interested party, considerably facilitating the entire organization and distribution of all products on the market that are the most crucial part of it. all movement of products in the hypermarket will be carried out using bar code readers, modernizing the functions and making them more effective. it is intended to include features that are able to allow the reception of orders from the supplier such as the movement of the warehouse to the sections and respective shelf, opening doors to a level of controlled orders and allowing the best organization of products. In addition to the remarkable implementation of the management of all products, the system also has functionalities for the sale of products, allowing the customer, if not satisfied, to be able to return a product within a maximum period to be defined.

## Project Calendarization

[Here you will find the project schedule represented in a Gantt diagram.](MarketManagement%20Diagrama%20de%20gantt.png)

The project has 6 goals as the main milestones to be achieved.

  ●Find out the requirements
    
As usual every project starts with the discovery of the requirements, through the sources of requirements such as stakeholders in the project for example.
    
  ●Requirements specification
  
After discovering the requirements and after the analysis and negotiation phase, we move to specification of the requirements where each requirement will undergo a rigorous description to understand what is expected of each requirement.

  ●Data base
  
Creation of the database with all tables (supplier, product, warehouse, sections, cash, purchase, invoice / receipt) that have already been analyzed for the best fulfillment of the functionalities and their related attributes.

  ●Application (code)
  
Use of programming knowledge for the effective use of database data with an appropriate interface for it, all the work of interaction with the user, graphic and functional design will be attributed to this milestone (use of php, html, mysql, javascript, css and any suitable language for the best functioning.

  ●Tests
  
Stage of testing the system as a whole and checking if it is satisfactory and complies with all the requirements presented and their respective functionalities.

  ●Identification of tasks to be performed
  
    
	Identification of all possible requirements sources for the creation of this system and the choice of them. assisting subsequent processes
    
    Discovery of the requirements from the requirements sources, communication with the interested party and the developers for complete efficiency in the discovery, they will be negotiated and identified only those agreed on by both parties as useful for the system
	
	Specification of all requirements, explaining their operation by providing documentation to the project, establishing an order that the system will have to address and will have to comply with them.    
    
	With the requirements already specified, we can start creating the databases that will act on the entire system, storing all relevant information for those interested, explained in the specification.    
    
	Creation of the entity-association model and relational model of the database.
    
	Direct implementation of the database in SQL (Structured Query Language) that will be used to implement the code, serving as the basis for the entire system.
    
	With the database in sql, the project goes to the application in code, making all the listing, editing, insertion, deletion of the data in the system itself, the requirements must all be met and later, as many requirements as necessary can be added (agreed) between both parties) to improve the system. The code always undergoes rigorous and descriptive analysis.
    
    Each of the code implementations in the system must pass a test, validating its efficiency and functionality to the system.
    
## Startup

The project needs some preparation to run on a local computer.
